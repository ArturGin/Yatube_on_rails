# README

A social-network project for getting my beak wet in Ruby on Rails.

Original written in Django: 
https://github.com/ArturGin/hw04_tests

A no thrill but solid foundation to get used to a new web-framework.

Includes:

- Authorization
- A bit of work setting up relational db
- Frontend written in .erb
- Bootstrap for CSS


What is my goal?

To see how similar from a usability poing of view I can get this project to the original.
Which would teach me the fundamentals of working with Ruby on Rails and show me areas in which I struggle
p.s Its going to be Bootstrap.
